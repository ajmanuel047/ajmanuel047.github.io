  <h1>Testing it out with codecademy instructions</h1>
  <p>I tried following the codecademy instructions to actually test this out.!</p>
 <p>The first one I tried did not work so I am trying another one</p>
 <p>Trying to figure out how long for a commit to go live</p>
  <running additional tests>
   <p>seems it takes below 20secs</p>
   <p>Seems it takes close to 5secs if done right</p>
   <p>You don't edit a commit. What you do is that you edit the main file and then your edit is created as a commit</p>
